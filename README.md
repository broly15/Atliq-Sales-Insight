## Problem Statement

In this project, we performed a sales insights analysis for AtliQ Hardware, an India-based company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to clients such as Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, etc. AtliQ Hardwareâ€™s head office is situated in Delhi, India, and it has multiple regional offices across the country.

The sales director faced significant challenges tracking sales in a dynamically growing market. Instead of relying on ad-hoc verbal reports from regional managers, a clear and data-driven picture of the business was needed. The goal was to create a simple data visualization tool that provides daily insights and empowers decision-making to boost sales.

## Data Discovery

#### Project Planning using AIMS Grid

AIMS Grid is a project management tool that consists of four components:
- **Purpose:** To unlock hidden sales insights and automate data gathering for improved decision support.
- **Stakeholders:** 
  - Sales Director
  - Marketing Team 
  - Customer Service Team
  - Data and Analytics Team
  - IT 
- **End Result:** An automated dashboard providing quick, up-to-date insights to support data-driven decision-making.
- **Success Criteria:**
  - A dashboard that uncovers sales order insights with the latest available data.
  - Empowering the sales team to make better decisions, resulting in a 10% cost saving.
  - Eliminating manual data gathering, saving 20% of business time to be reinvested in value-added activities.

## Data Analysis using MySQL

After data discovery, MySQL was used for analysis. The SQL database dump is provided in the `db_dump.sql` file. Download this file to your local machine and import it into MySQL Workbench.

**Steps:**

- **Importing Data to MySQL Workbench**

- **Analysis Overview:**

  - Identify and filter out garbage values (e.g., incorrect market entries and negative sales amounts).
  - Detect transactions in USD and convert them to INR where necessary.

**Sample Queries:**

1. Retrieve all customer records:  
   `SELECT * FROM sales.customers;`
2. Count total number of customers:  
   `SELECT count(*) FROM sales.customers;`
3. Retrieve transactions for Chennai (market code: Mark001):  
   `SELECT * FROM sales.transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';`
4. Retrieve distinct product codes sold in Chennai:  
   `SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM sales.transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';`
5. Retrieve transactions for Mumbai (market code: Mark002):  
   `SELECT * FROM sales.transactions WHERE market_code='Mark002';`
6. Retrieve distinct product codes sold in Mumbai:  
   `SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM sales.transactions WHERE market_code='Mark002';`
7. Retrieve transactions in USD:  
   `SELECT * FROM sales.transactions WHERE currency="USD";`
8. Join transactions with the date table for the year 2020:  
   `SELECT sales.transactions.*, sales.date.* FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date = sales.date.date WHERE sales.date.year = 2020;`
9. Sum total revenue for 2020:  
   `SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date = sales.date.date WHERE sales.date.year = 2020 AND (sales.transactions.currency="INR" OR sales.transactions.currency="USD");`

*(Additional queries follow similar patterns.)*

## Data Cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

**Steps:**

1. **Connect MySQL Database with Power BI Desktop:**  
   Import all tables from the MySQL database into Power BI.

2. **Data Loading:**  
   Load the data into Power BI Desktop to build a star schema model.

3. **Data Transformation Using Power Query:**  
   - Filter rows with null or blank values.
   - Remove unwanted values (e.g., negative or zero amounts in transactions).
   - Convert USD to INR by adding a new column using a conditional formula:
     ```
     = Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_sales_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" then [sales_amount] * 75 else [sales_amount])
     ```

4. **Handling Duplicates:**  
   Identify and remove duplicate currency entries in MySQL Workbench to maintain data integrity.

## Data Modeling

After cleaning and transforming the dataset, a data model was created. The sales insights tables form a star schema as shown below:

## Data Analysis (DAX)

Key measures used in visualizations:

- **Profit Margin %:**  
  `DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin], [Revenue], 0)`
  
- **Profit Margin Contribution %:**  
  `DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin], CALCULATE([Total Profit Margin], ALL('sales products'), ALL('sales customers'), ALL('sales markets')))`
  
- **Revenue:**  
  `SUM('sales transactions'[sales_amount])`
  
- **Revenue Contribution %:**  
  `DIVIDE([Revenue], CALCULATE([Revenue], ALL('sales products'), ALL('sales customers'), ALL('sales markets')))`
  
- **Revenue LY:**  
  `CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('sales date'[date]))`
  
- **Sales Quantity:**  
  `SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])`
  
- **Total Profit Margin:**  
  `SUM('sales transactions'[Profit_Margin])`

**Profit Target:**

- **Profit Target1:**  
  `GENERATESERIES(-0.05, 0.15, 0.01)`
  
- **Profit Target Value:**  
  `SELECTEDVALUE('Profit Target1'[Profit Target])`
  
- **Target Difference:**  
  `[Profit Margin %] - 'Profit Target1'[Profit Target Value]`

## Build Dashboard or a Report

Data visualizations were created using Microsoft Power BI Desktop, providing key insights into sales performance:
